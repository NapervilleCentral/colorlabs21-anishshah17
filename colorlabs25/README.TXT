PROJECT TITLE: Shepard Fairy 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Changing the colors of a picture
VERSION or DATE: 11/14/2025
AUTHORS: Anish Shah

1) Thomas
	- I like the brightness of the picture, lots of pink and purple so try adding it some greys or whites

2) Hashir
        - The slate grey is nice, but I feel like it has too much of a grayscale vibe, and the navy doesn't stand out.

3) Ayush
        - The purple and cream are nice, but I feel like it's too loud and isn't soothing to the eye, doesn't really fit the picture

4) Nick
        - I really like the vintage vibe that this picture gives with the orange and cream and the navy in the background.
